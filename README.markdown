Tash
=========

#### An event-based common JavaScript Library ####

Tash is a small, simple Javascript library, containing a set of common namespaced 
functions, useful for common tasks. Its intent is to group in a reusable library
the basic patterns and functions that should be the base of any Javascript application.

Tash offers:

* A namespacing system (module pattern)
* A publish/subscribe system (synchronous and asynchronous)
* other common utilities under development

### Targeted platforms ###

Prototype currently targets the following platforms:

* Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows, version 6.0 and higher
* Mozilla Firefox 4 and higher
* Apple Safari 4 and higher
* Opera 10 and higher
* Chrome

### Note to the reader ###

This library is still in development and currently in version 0.1.
I've still to add aggregation/minification support and normalize the code. 
The library, as it is now, is not yet ready to be used. It will be ready when it will reach
version 0.2, around November 25th 2011.
